Identify and protect crucial leopard habitats, such as national parks, wildlife sanctuaries, and corridors.
Support habitat restoration projects to enhance and reconnect fragmented landscapes, ensuring sufficient space for leopard populations to thrive.
Human-Wildlife Conflict Mitigation:

Develop and implement effective strategies to mitigate conflicts between leopards and local communities, such as secure livestock pens and community-based early warning systems.
Educate communities on coexisting with leopards and provide support for the compensation of livestock losses.
Anti-Poaching Measures:

Strengthen law enforcement efforts to combat poaching, including increased patrols and the use of technology for surveillance.
Implement strict penalties for wildlife poaching and trafficking to deter illegal activities.
Research and Monitoring:

Conduct ongoing research on Sri Lankan leopard populations to monitor their health, behavior, and population dynamics.
Use technology, such as camera traps and GPS collars, to gather data on leopard movements and identify key habitats.
Community Engagement and Education:

Conduct awareness programs in local communities to promote understanding and appreciation of leopards.
Involve local communities in conservation efforts, fostering a sense of responsibility and pride in protecting their natural heritage.
Tourism Management:

Implement responsible tourism practices in wildlife reserves to minimize disturbance to leopard habitats.
Establish and enforce ethical guidelines for wildlife viewing, ensuring the safety and well-being of both leopards and visitors.
