  <h1 id="wilpattu-title">Unveiling the Past: Yala National Park's Rich History</h1>
   
  <p>Yala, one of Sri Lanka's oldest national parks, achieved wildlife sanctuary status in 1900 and was formally established as a national park in 1938, 
      making it one of the first two national parks in the country, alongside Wilpattu. Nestled in the heart of Yala is the ancient Buddhist temple Sithulpawa, 
      believed to have roots dating back 2,000 years. Renowned for its rich biodiversity, Yala is home to 44 mammal species and 215 bird species, playing a crucial role in 
      the conservation of Sri Lankan elephants, leopards, and aquatic birds. The park boasts an extraordinary concentration of leopards, making it one of the prime locations 
      globally for these elusive big cats. Situated in a dry semi-arid region, Yala experiences an average annual rainfall ranging from 500 to 775 millimeters, with temperatures 
      varying between 26.4°C in January and 30°C in April. Additionally, the park features natural rock pools that provide a perennial water source and is bordered by the sea 
      to the southeast, showcasing stunning natural beaches and sand dunes. Explore the wonders of Yala, where history, biodiversity, and natural beauty converge in an 
      unforgettable experience.</p>

  <ul>
      <li><strong>Location:</strong> Yala is situated in Sri Lanka's south-east, along the Indian Ocean, covering nearly 130,000 hectares.</li><br> 
      <li><strong>Historical Transformation:</strong> Initially used as a hunting ground for the elite during British rule, Yala has undergone a significant transformation into a conservation area, reflecting a shift in attitudes towards wildlife preservation.</li><br>
      <li><strong>Recommended Visiting Period:</strong> The period between February and July is optimal for visitors. Lower water levels during this time encourage animals to emerge into open areas, increasing the likelihood of wildlife sightings.</li><br>
